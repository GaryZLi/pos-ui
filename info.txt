- maybe a button to text delivery info to phone -> addr, phone, order total
- a reject button, 
- reject modal too?
- button to check karsh or not
- add customer name section
- panel for pay later
- add a filter  for menu
- on exist, preserve state until delete all
- split bill
- under charge, in case someone card declines, or switch payment etc
- select certain items button -> maybe focusedItems to focusedItemss = {}

- the menu should have a list opping up and price null IF it has options
- should have alert on reject phones,
- what if we open a order, and then edit?
    - in this case, we should check if the orderList has a order number, if so, we should alter that shit
